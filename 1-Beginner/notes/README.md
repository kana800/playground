### [Desktop GUI](desktopgui)

I know this is bad style of coding but this is my first project where i coded using `C++` using the framework `PyQt5` and half of the code is incomplete, I need to get better at class syntax in `C++`. Currently the user can:

-  user can create a note
-  user can edit a note
-  user can kinda save a note

To Run:
-  Navigate into the `desktopgui` folder and use `make` to compile the project
```
make && ./main
```
