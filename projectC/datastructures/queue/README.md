#### Implementation of a queue using Linked List: [C](C_LL) & [C++](C++_LL)

- [ ] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
  - [ ] enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
  - [ ] dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
  - [ ] empty()

- [ ] Implement using fixed-sized array:
  - [ ] enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
  - [ ] dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
  - [ ] empty()
  - [ ] full()
